Youok im here
8:56 PMYouholy shit why do you have so many open tabs
8:57 PMKevin Caii reasearch
8:57 PMYouok
8:57 PMKevin Caithat isnt even the most i have
8:58 PMKevin Caiusually i can go upto around 100tabs
8:58 PMKevin Caiik its dumb
8:58 PMYouhow do you organize that
8:58 PMKevin Caii just do m8
8:58 PMYoukthen with ur wizard magic
8:58 PMKevin Cailol
8:59 PMKevin Caianyways
8:59 PMKevin CaiI can implement ur idea
8:59 PMKevin Caibut
8:59 PMKevin Caisince we are going to cut things off 
8:59 PMKevin Cailike having a truly 2d planeeven though it isnt 90 degrees>
9:00 PMKevin Caiis that possible
9:00 PMYoudefine cut things off in this instance
9:00 PMKevin Cailike you know if something is diagonal
9:01 PMYouok
9:01 PMKevin Caiand its a straight line
9:01 PMYouu know the plane is transparent right?
9:01 PMYouit was shaded just for clarity
9:01 PMKevin Caiye
9:01 PMYouok
9:01 PMKevin Caibut if u cut and need to create a truly 2d platformer
9:02 PMKevin Caihows that going to work
9:02 PMKevin Cairerember the image ive given u
9:02 PMKevin Caiis it going to be just solid for that section?
9:02 PMKevin Cailike it should right
9:02 PMYouright well we can simulate it with faux 2d if that makes it easier
9:02 PMKevin Caiwtf is faux
9:03 PMKevin Caifake?
9:03 PMYouyes
9:03 PMKevin Caidont nee to be fancy m80
9:03 PMYouthat is normal english
9:03 PMKevin Caiew
9:04 PMYoulike "guy faux"?
9:04 PMYouknow him?
9:04 PMKevin Caiye
9:04 PMKevin Caikk
9:04 PMKevin Caianyways bak to the subject
9:04 PMYouright i guess im not fluent in 1337 5p34k
9:04 PMKevin Caishould we have a loading bar
9:04 PMYoujust a static icon works
9:04 PMKevin Cairn its loading
9:04 PMKevin Caiit takes time
9:05 PMYoujust use a static icon
9:05 PMKevin Caikk
9:06 PMKevin Caianyways
9:06 PMKevin Caiwhat i was thinking
9:06 PMKevin Caiis that if its partially cut
9:06 PMKevin Caiwe see which block is closest to the line
9:06 PMYouyes
9:07 PMKevin Caiand then use that in place of the thing
9:07 PMYouoh btwe i found a good loading image which i will email u
9:07 PMYouok
9:07 PMKevin Caibc chances are its just 2 solid blocks with the same ID
9:07 PMYouye
9:07 PMKevin Caiso it wont matter
9:07 PMYouok
9:07 PMKevin Caibut moving diagonally is an issue
9:07 PMYoulike jumping in an arc or?
9:08 PMKevin Caibc then the corss sections will bedifferent
9:08 PMYouwhen u say moving diaganolly be specific what are u referring to
9:08 PMKevin Cailike not parrallel to the z or x axis
9:08 PMYouok
9:08 PMKevin Caiso like the image will be distorted
9:09 PMKevin CaiI have an idea
9:09 PMKevin Caiwe dont need no crappy 2d physics
9:09 PMKevin Caiwe can still have 3d rendering
9:09 PMYouoh the references
9:09 PMYouok
9:09 PMKevin Caibut after each rotation
9:09 PMKevin Caiwe can still render 3d
9:10 PMKevin Caibc i can apparently make a room up to 100 by 100 by 100 blocks
9:10 PMKevin Caiand we can use ur idea
9:10 PMYouok im not sure i follow now
9:10 PMKevin Caithat i rejected
9:10 PMYouok
9:10 PMKevin Caithat image u sent me
9:11 PMKevin Caiwe can still ue dat
9:11 PMKevin Caiuse*
9:11 PMYouwell ok hold on lemme speak
9:11 PMKevin Caibut actual player movement will still be liomited to the line the angle you rotated
9:11 PMYouyes
9:11 PMYoubut ok hear me out for a sec
9:11 PMKevin Caiye?
9:11 PMKevin Caiwe can have ur idea
9:11 PMKevin Caibc earlier i was thinkin abt graphical limitations
9:11 PMYouI am not opposed to your idea, I just brought up my suggestion because it seemed more seamless for gameplay in my head, but did u delete the progress for your version or did you back that up
9:12 PMYou?
9:12 PMKevin Cainow all we gotta do is check which part of the nearby boxes actually intersect the line
9:12 PMYouyes
9:12 PMKevin Caino i was relaxing m80
9:12 PMKevin Caii was playin on clash of calns
9:13 PMKevin Caiand making a bot for it
9:13 PMYouomg u casual normie
9:13 PMYoureeeeee
9:13 PMYouanyways
9:13 PMKevin Caiopencv is a nice thing
9:13 PMKevin Caiok bak to the topic
9:13 PMKevin Caiusing basic collision detection stuff
9:13 PMYouif my idea for the gameplay is actually worse, keep a save of your progress on your version as backup
9:14 PMYoujust in case
9:14 PMKevin Caikk
9:14 PMYouk
9:14 PMYoui assume by the end of the week or something we could get a preliminary render of the new version?
9:14 PMKevin Caiok did that
9:14 PMKevin Caisure
9:14 PMYouok
9:15 PMKevin Caiim not free tmrrw
9:15 PMYouthats fine
9:15 PMYoubut listen up
9:15 PMKevin Caiye
9:15 PMYounow that i know there will just be a line instead of a plane,
9:15 PMYouI can design the combat with that in mind
9:15 PMKevin Caiye
9:15 PMYoui didn't have time to actually update the storyboard yet today, but I will now
9:15 PMKevin Caiusing some basic collision algorithms i can deal with stuff
9:16 PMYouok
9:16 PMKevin Caiwait
9:16 PMKevin Caiits intersection by a plane, not a line
9:16 PMYouik
9:16 PMKevin Caiye
9:16 PMYoui just used line as shorthand
9:16 PMKevin Caiso ik where which part of which blocks intersect the plane
9:16 PMYoumhm
9:16 PMKevin Caiye pls document dis
9:16 PMKevin Caibrb
9:16 PMYoumake another txt file
9:17 PM
